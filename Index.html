  <h3>Malware</h3>
   The term Malware stands for malicious software which can infect your computer like how the human body can get an infection. There are many different types of malware and each present with their own distinct symptoms that sets one malware from another. <p>
  One of these malwares is a virus. This is an infamous term and is often used interchangeably with malware; but contrary to popular belief the term virus means a malware that has the property to replicate itself by infecting other soft wares on the host system. There are many different types of viruses but they pretty much all serve one purpose which is to give the creator access to the machine from the inside or to take over large networks of systems. There are a few exceptions where a virus is created simply to cause massive damage however viruses are made more often in attempts of a financial gain. The most obvious way to protect yourself from a virus is to practice common sense once you are online. <p>
  Adware is another malware that is probably the most annoying that you can encounter. As the name suggests its purpose is to advertise products. The creator of an adware is usually a company that wants to get popular. Usually adwares are not illegal because they don’t break the law; all they do is bombard the system with advertisements. No one intends to download an adware so the way it gets into your system is by something called a drive by download. A drive by download is just when another program is downloaded without the user's knowledge or consent along with a legitimate program the user intends to download. The symptoms of an adware are multiple pop ups or pop ups that replicate when you close them, the ads appear in random places, your browser homepage is changed by itself, the usual websites that you visit are not showing up correctly or the links you click are being redirected to a different page than expected. A more subtle sign of an adware include the browser working slower than before with relatively more crashes. The only way to get rid of it is to reboot your computer to a previously backed up version of your system. <p> 
  The next kind of malware is called a spyware. This is a malicious program whose sole purpose is to spy of the activities of the host system. This can mean everything from finding out passwords saved on the system to the websites the user visits most often. This information can be used for many things such as getting access to your email or back account. All in all spywares are dangerous as they work undercover as in they are not easily detected by anti-viruses so for you to find out about a spyware infecting your computer is improbable unless you check routinely for such a software. <p>
  There are more kinds of malware but the ones mentioned here are more common than others. To keep safe from pretty much any of these you just need to use common sense. This can mean anything from not opening random links sent via mail by friends or strangers to not downloading from sketchy websites.

    <h3>Ways that a Hacker gets your information</h3>
    There are many ways that a hacker gets your information. Essentially a hacker looks at different weaknesses in the system which you are using. One of the first things that a hacker would try to get a hold of is your private information such as passwords. There are multiple ways to do this. <p> 
    One of the many ways a hacker gets your information is by phishing. This method is where the hacker makes a fake webpage that looks identical to another existing reliable page. A user thinks they are signing into the legitimate page but instead they are tricked to signing into the fake page thereby sending the password to the hacker instead of the real servers. To protect yourself from phishing attacks you can simply verify the authenticity of the website by clicking on the lock on the left of the URL. This will prompt a pop up. On this pop-up you can see the certificates that the website has. If the certificates are verified then the webpage is legit and you can continue signing in but if the website is not verified then do not log in as this is probably an attempt to phish for your data. However a better practice would be to just not give your account details to sketchy websites. <p>
    The other way that hackers attempt to get your information is called social engineering. Social engineering is a bit risky for the hacker as this time it is him confronting the victim in some sort of disguise. The most famous example of this is the Nigerian prince scam. This was a real scam which involved the victims receiving an email from a man who claimed to be a Nigerian prince who promises to give you, the victim, some money in exchange for your bank account details so he can transfer money into your account. At first it was emails from some “Nigerian prince” however nowadays it has become a more global scam. For scams like these you just need to be cautious about with whom you share your information and what information you share. <p>
    There are many more scams or ways the hackers can prey on your information but there are ways that you can protect yourself. Look at the tips section to find ways to stay safe online.

   <h3> There are several ways to make sure that you are safe online. One of the ways to ensure safety is </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have strong passwords on everything.</li>
        <li>Ensure that you check verification of the sites to whom you give your sensitive information. </li>
        <li>Try to give minimal and/or fake information online.</li>
        <li>Enable two factor authentication for all accounts possible.</li>
        <li>Use Password managers for all of your accoutns to minimalize phishing attacks.</li>
        <li>Do not visit sketchy sites at all and do not download from them. </li>
        <li>Do not use torrents or pirate as they can not be 100% trusted and can compromise your system. </li>
        <li>Only download from a trusted website. </li>
        <li>Use a VPN espcially when using a public network. </li>
        <li>Keep your devices with you at all times to make sure no hackers can physically get access to your computer. </li>
        <li>Keep unknown devices away from your own. For example do not plug in unknown USBs into your computer. </li>
        <li>Do not open links you find in emails, especially if the email is sent by a stranger. </li>
        <li>Keep backing up your data so that if you do get affected by a malware you can revert back to a recently saved version. </li>
        <li>Activate a firewall </li>
        <li>Install an anti-virus. </li>
        <li>Monitor your account activity </li>
        <li>Do not share your locations online. This means you may want to block notifications from websites and post less on social medias. </li>
        <li>Whenever possible update your OS to make sure the vulnerabilities of older versions do not compromise your data. </li>
        <li>Frequently change passwords on all your accounts. </li>
        <li>When downloading any app read reviews or make sure its authenticity is verified so its not an attempt by hackers to get your information. </li>
        <li>Do not respond to texts by phone numbers that are not long enough and belong to someone you do not know because shorter phone   
            numbers are what belongs to email to text services. </li>
        <li>Do not give you private information to websites that starts with http; the URL hass to start with https to be reliable. </li>
        <li>Do not click on ads as these can lead to malicious websites.  </li>
        <li>Have an ad blocker to avoid getting advertisements of sites altogether.</li>
        <li>Download applications only from reliable or verified source </li>
        <li>Get rid of unwanted software so that you can keep tabs on what applications reside in your system. </li>
        <li>Cover the camera of your laptop with something that can disable the camera physically and no scripts can then gain access to 
            <br>your camera </li>
        <li>Create multiple emails so none of them can be traced back to you thus giving you anonymity, to a degree. </li>
        <li>Disable Bluetooth and disable the Wi-Fi auto connect feature in order to minimize your cyber footprint. </li>
        <li>Finally keep in mind that you, despite all the steps you may take to secure yourself, you are still under threat, less than 
            others who do not take the correct steps to ensure security, but are still under threat of some sort so have a plan ready to go in case of being attacked. </li>
      </ol>
